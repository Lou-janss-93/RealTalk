## **REALTALK**

## Inspiration
In an age where social platforms connect people more than ever, many still feel not truly *heard*.
I had an idea and wanted to create a place where people can share their raw thoughts, free from judgment, algorithms, and dopamine addiction. Thus **Real Talk** was born: an anonymous, real-time conversation platform for anyone who just wants to be truly heard without the fluff.

## What it does
Real Talk allows users to participate in a live conversation board without profiles, likes, or filters. Just authentic talking. The platform supports real-time messaging, a simple interface, and optional guiding prompts to kickstart conversations when words momentarily fail.

## How we built it
The frontend is built with **Bolt** and **React**, while ** Supabase** handles the backend for authentication and data storage. Supabase's Auth and RLS ensure secure, anonymous login and access control. For real-time functionality, I rely on Bolt's rapid deployment, and built-in components. 

## Teamwork 
Real Talk is the result of close collaboration among team members, each contributing their own expertise, from frontend development and backend architecture to UX design and project management. This collective effort enabled us to build and iterate quickly within the hackathon deadline. 

## Challenges 
I personally ran into the integration of Supabase with Bolt caused some headaches,  especially around authentication and securing user input. The pressure was high, so I had to constantly balance speed with a clear, minimalistic user experience.  

## Accomplishments 
I'm proud of - Basic system running within 24 hours - Secure integration of Supabase with a modern frontend, A tool designed that I would personally like to use 

## What's next ?
The plans for Real Talk include: - Optional emotion tagging for posts - Lightweight moderation tools for safety - Improved mobile responsiveness and offline caching
